## Summary

I'm a multidisciplinary product designer who thrives at the intersection of UX, brand, and frontend development. With over a decade of experience spanning B2B SaaS, consumer platforms, and immersive installations, I design elegant, scalable solutions grounded in empathy and craft.

My work spans early-stage startups to global brands, with specialties in:

• End-to-end product design (UX/UI, interaction, visual systems)
• Frontend development (React, Next.js, Tailwind)
• Branding and storytelling for digital experiences
• AI-integrated workflows and emerging tech

I've helped build everything from internal enterprise platforms to AI-driven health tools, from spatial installations to browser-based IDEs. Whether I'm in Figma or VS Code, I move fluidly from idea to implementation.

Currently seeking roles where thoughtful design, storytelling, and technology meet.
