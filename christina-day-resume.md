## Summary

I'm a Senior Product Designer with 10+ years of experience designing data-rich platforms, internal tools, and customer-facing products across B2B SaaS and emerging technology. I specialize in turning complex, ambiguous problem spaces into clear, intuitive experiences—working from first principles and balancing user needs, technical constraints, and business goals.

I've led end-to-end product design for systems that support high-stakes decision-making, partnering closely with product, engineering, and data teams from discovery through launch. My work often sits at the intersection of data, systems, and human judgment, where clarity and trust are essential, and I'm most excited by products where thoughtful design has real leverage on decisions, outcomes, and scale.
