# AI Tools Experience Summary

I bring over a decade of production codebase experience to my AI-assisted development approach, having contributed as a frontend engineer at companies like ZeroCater (2+ years) and Betterview, where I built client dashboards, internal tools, and complex data visualization systems. I have extensive hands-on experience using advanced AI development tools in production environments, including Cursor IDE with MCP (Model Context Protocol) for accelerated full-stack development. I recently built a complete 6-month project (UpDrift.me) using AI-assisted workflows that achieved 3-5x faster iteration cycles while maintaining high code quality and architectural integrity. My approach treats AI as a force multiplier for senior-level technical decision making - leveraging it for rapid prototyping and implementation while maintaining critical oversight for architecture, security, and user experience.
