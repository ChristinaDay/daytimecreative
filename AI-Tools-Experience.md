# AI Tools Experience Summary

I bring over a decade of production codebase experience to my AI-assisted development approach, having contributed as a frontend engineer at companies like ZeroCater (2+ years) and Betterview, where I built client dashboards, internal tools, and complex data visualization systems. I have extensive hands-on experience using advanced AI development tools in production environments, including Cursor IDE with MCP (Model Context Protocol) for accelerated full-stack development. I recently built a complete 6-month project (UpDrift.me) using AI-assisted workflows that achieved 3-5x faster iteration cycles while maintaining high code quality and architectural integrity. My approach treats AI as a force multiplier for senior-level technical decision making - leveraging it for rapid prototyping and implementation while maintaining critical oversight for architecture, security, and user experience.

## Specific AI Dev Tools Experience

**Daily Workflow Tools:**
- **Cursor IDE**: Primary development environment with Claude Sonnet integration for context-aware code completion, refactoring, and architectural discussions
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Advanced tool integration for codebase analysis, automated testing, and deployment workflows
- **Claude/ChatGPT**: Design iteration, technical research, and problem-solving partner for complex architectural decisions

**Production Applications:**
- **UpDrift.me (6-month project)**: Full-stack React/Node.js application built with 70% AI assistance, including database design, API architecture, and responsive UI/UX
- **Portfolio 2025**: Current project showcasing cutting-edge design patterns and modern development workflows, demonstrating AI-assisted rapid prototyping while maintaining design system consistency
- **Code Migration & Transformation**: Experience using AI tools for large-scale codebase refactoring, dependency updates, and framework migrations

**Design-Engineering Hybrid Approach:**
- Use AI for rapid design iteration and component generation while maintaining human oversight for UX decisions and accessibility
- Leverage AI for CSS/styling optimization and cross-browser compatibility testing
- AI-assisted creation of design systems and component libraries with consistent patterns and documentation

**Impact & Productivity:**
- 3-5x faster iteration cycles compared to traditional development workflows
- Maintained senior-level code quality and architectural integrity throughout AI-assisted projects
- Successfully deployed production applications built with significant AI tooling assistance

## Production Code Experience

**Yes - I have extensive experience writing and shipping code to production environments across multiple companies:**

**ZeroCater (2+ years total, 2016-2018):** As Product Designer, I collaborated directly with engineering teams to build production-ready frontend components and maintain design systems. I helped launch the new Kitchens & Snacks product, working hands-on to improve client dashboards and internal tools that served thousands of daily users. My role involved writing production code for web applications, implementing responsive design systems, and creating reusable component libraries.

**Betterview (6 months, 2021):** As the sole supporting UX Designer on their property intelligence platform, I developed and shipped flexible, component-based systems for customizable insurer workflows. I worked cross-functionally with product managers, engineers, and data scientists to implement complex data visualizations including modular property detail views, risk overlay maps, and parcel-level visualizations that processed and displayed real-time property data for insurance companies.

**Recent Projects:** I recently completed UpDrift.me, a full-stack React/Node.js application built with AI-assisted workflows, and I'm currently building Portfolio 2025 using cutting-edge development patterns. Both projects demonstrate my ability to ship production code using modern frameworks (React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) while maintaining high code quality and architectural integrity.

My approach combines senior-level frontend development skills with design thinking, allowing me to build user-facing features that are both technically sound and user-centered.
